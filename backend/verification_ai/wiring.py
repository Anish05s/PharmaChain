─────────────────────────
Central helper called by supplier and consumer routers after a handoff
record is saved.  Loads all available handoff records for a shipment,
builds PartyReport objects, runs the cross-match engine, writes an
AIFlag row to the DB, and dispatches the blockchain BackgroundTask.

Rules (from master prompt):
  • < 2 handoffs   → return PENDING, no AIFlag written yet
  • 2 or 3 parties → run cross-match
  • FLAGGED        → call blockchain_service.flag_shipment()
  • VERIFIED       → add bg_record_handoff_and_store as BackgroundTask
  • Always write AIFlag to DB when we have >= 2 parties
